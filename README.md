# This Repository
 <p> Being someone who's trying to gain the skills of a front-end developer, I took on a task that is commonly asked of the position, Code Refactoring. It is the process of taking an exisiting code and restructing it, without changing external behavior. Refactoring a code is intented to improve nonfunctional attritbutes, also making the website more accessible. It is important to consider web accessibility, beacuse there are people who may have disabilities leaving restrictions. It will help them access a website better, and prevent legal action from possibly being taken. </p>

 <p>For this project, I took an exisiting code for a webpage, restructured the HTML and CSS files to have it meet certain accessibility criterias. I took an intiative to tidy the source code up, ensure links are properly functioning, and leave comments for the changed I made to the codebase or page.In effect, making the site more optimized for search engines. 
Here is a list of some changes I made to the source code to fufill certain accesibilty criterias-
  <ul>
    <li>Replaced HTML elements with semantic HTML elements</li>
    <li>Added accessible alt attributes to images incorporated</li>
    <li>Provided a descriptive title to title element</li>
    <li>Structured HTML elements to follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning</li>
    <li>Structure headings to be in sequential order</li>
    </ul>
 </p>
 
 Lastly, I also added some touches of my own to spruce up and highlight images on the webpage and work on my CSS skills.

## Installation

When is comes to Code Refactoring, you take an existing code base given to you, or forked from another person's work, and you restructure it in your code editor. This will include an index.html and a style.css file.
For my code editor, I use [visual Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), which can be installed from their website. A quick tip when it comes to refactoring a code

## Usage 

Here is an example of the changes I made to the source code. You can see that I added notes to help get a clear understanding.
